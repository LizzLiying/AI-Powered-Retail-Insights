# Beyond Traditional Methods: AI-Powered Retail Insights

## Capstone project on creating an advanced AI-driven data analystics system using Python

### Problem Statement
Traditional data analysis methods such as spreadsheets and basic statistical analysis are often inadequate for modern retail data due to:
- Data volume and complexity
- Data quality issues
- Limited insights
- Limited on predictive analytics tools
- Scalability.

Advanced techniques like data mining, machine learning, and AI are better suited to handle thses challenges and extract valuable insights.

### Dataset used for the capstone project

Description of dataset:
This dataset contains detailed records of coffee sales from a vending machine. The dataset spans from March 2024 to present time, capturing daily transaction data. It is intended for analysis of purchasing patterns, sales trends, and customer preferences related to coffee products.

### Using machine learning models to extract valuable insights

It is difficult to accurately categorize customers into segmentation due to:
- Customers have varied demographics, purchase behaviours, and preferences.
- Customers preferences and behaviours can change over time.
- Data quality issues such as incomplete or inaccurate data can dinder the effectiveness of segmentation efforts.

Making an accurate sales forecasting can be difficult due to:
- Stockouts or excessive inventory can impact sales
- Changes in pricing can affect demand and sales
- Ecnonomic factors like inflation, interest rates and consumer confidence can influence sales.

Making accurate product demand can be difficult due to:
- Demand fluctuates due to seasonal factors and promotional activities
- Economic conditions, competitve landscape, and supply chain disruptions can significantly impact demand.
- Demand for products throughout their life cycle, from introduction to maturity and decline.

### Conclusion
Machine Learning is transforming retail by extracting insights from data and helping retailers enhance customer satisfaction, increase sales, reduce costs, and gain a competitive edge.
