# Beyond Traditional Methods: AI-Powered Retail Insights

## Capstone project on creating an advanced AI-driven data analystics system using Python

### Problem Statement
Traditional data analysis methods such as spreadsheets and basic statistical analysis are often inadequate for modern retail data due to:
- Data volume and complexity
- Data quality issues
- Limited insights
- Limited on predictive analytics tools
- Scalability.

Advanced techniques like data mining, machine learning, and AI are better suited to handle thses challenges and extract valuable insights.
